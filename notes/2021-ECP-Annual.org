* WG Summary
 - *Problem:* Given the size and structure of the PMIx standard document, it can be difficult to find the PMIx components necessary for a given use case
 - *Goal:* Provide a mechanism for focusing in on the aspects of the standard that are of interest to a particular user/use case
 - *Proposed solution:* create an appendix with a list of high-level use cases and the PMIx APIs required to support them
