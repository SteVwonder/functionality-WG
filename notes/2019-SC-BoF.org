* Executive Summary
 - *Problem:* Given the size and structure of the PMIx standard document, it can be difficult to find the PMIx components necessary for a given use-case
 - *Goal:* Provide a mechanism for focusing in on the aspects of the standard that are of interest to a particular user/use-case
 - *Proposed solution:* compile a list of high-level use-cases and the PMIx capabilities required to support them

 - Use-Case Milestone 2 (Q1/Q2 2020):

   - instant-on
   - workflow/application management
** Long-term:
 - Add interfaces for querying "use-case support"
