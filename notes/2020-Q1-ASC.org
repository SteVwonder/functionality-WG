* WG Summary?
 - *Problem:* Given the size and structure of the PMIx standard document, it can be difficult to find the PMIx components necessary for a given use-case
 - *Goal:* Provide a mechanism for focusing in on the aspects of the standard that are of interest to a particular user/use-case
 - *Proposed solution:* compile a list of high-level use-cases and the PMIx capabilities required to support them
* Goals
** Short-term:
 - Use-Case Milestone 1 (Jan 2020):
   - bootstrap (business card exchange)
   - debuggers / tools
 - Use-Case Milestone 2 (End of Q1 2020):
   - hybrid programming models
   - instant-on
   - workflow management
   - application management
* Goals
** Long-term:
 - Identify and document emerging use-cases, working with other WGs where applicable:
   - tiered storage
   - power control
   - groups/flexible allocations
   - fault tolerance
   - cross-version compatibility
 - Begin integrating use-cases into the standard document
 - Add interfaces into the standard for querying "use-case support"
* Work Completed So Far
 - Reviewed each RFC, documenting the interfaces and use-cases covered
   - Aggregated the RFC notes into rough slices
 - First Round of Use-Cases
   - bootstrap (business card exchange)
   - debuggers / tools
   - hybrid programming models
